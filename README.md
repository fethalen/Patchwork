Patchwork is an alignment-based program for retrieving and concatenating
phylogenetic markers from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. The program
searches the provided DNA query contigs against one or more amino acid reference
sequences. Multiple, overlapping hits are merged to derive a single, continuous
sequence for each reference sequence.

### Features

* Align nucleotide sequences to one or more protein sequences
* Works with already assembled contigs _or_ raw reads
* Stitch overlapping or gappy sequences together based on a reference
* Find homologs, even in distantly-related taxa
* üêá Written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and utilizing
  [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) for maximum speed

### Quick installation

We are currently working on a Conda build. In the future,
the user will be able to install this program by running `conda
install -c bioconda patchwork`. Until then, please refer to
[these instructions](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork/wiki/4.-Installation)
for installing from source. It is now also possible to [install
Patchwork using Docker](https://github.com/fethalen/Patchwork/wiki/4.-Installation#installing-patchwork-with-docker).
